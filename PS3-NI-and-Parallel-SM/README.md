Problem Set 3 - Assignment - Numerical integration and Shared-memory Parallelization
- Goal here is to calculates the integral of 4/(1+x^2) between xi=0 and xf=1 using left rieman sum, we want to see the performance from parallel and serial, compare
- Also learning to perform an scaling analysis


Current Problems:
- serial and parallel have marignal times, but parallel is quicker slightly

Reference:
- vanzor - TickTock to time the codes and compare
- Lecture notes

TIMES:
- Serial - 0.1 sec
- Parallel(6 Threads) - 0.08 sec
