Assignment: Numerical integration and Shared-memory Parallelization

1. Write a (serial) program that calculates the integral of 4/(1+x^2) between xi=0 and xf=1.
For doing this, one could approximate the integral as follows h SUM (4/( 1 + xi^2)) with i varying from 1 to N, where xi = i*h, h = 1/N. This is known as the left Riemann sum.
- Done in Serial Folder
2. Verify your implementation comparing against the expected analytical solution, which should be "pi".
- ERROR not sure as the sum is increasing as parition increases
3. Provide an estimate of the numerical error and possible causes. Justify this with some nunerical experimentation.
- STILL NEED TO DO
4. Parallelize your implementation using a shared-memory approach.
- Done in Parallel Folder(Needs work as times are too similar)
5. Perform an scaling analysis, by comparing the runtime in different cases, e.g. serial, and multiple number of threads. Plot your results generating an scaling curve for your implementation. Recall to perform your scaling analyis in an appropiate setup, i.e. not running in a shared resource in the system.
- STILL NEED TO DO
