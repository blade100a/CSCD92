Problem set 2
- This coding activity was not from the problem set 2, but was a topic covered from the part 2
- It creates a fftw_complex which filled with {1, 2, 3...} then creates a plan to fft the fftw_complex to y
- Outputs the complex equations that resulted from the fftw plan

Main Idea:
- Was to try and work on FFT package and understand what occurs or happens
- Creates an fftw_complex x which is of real numbers of 1-"N" and imaginary 0
- Performs and computes the one-dimensional Fourier transform and outputs the complex equations gained from the FFT
- The equations gained from this FFT is based off a frequency domain
- THE CALL:g++ fft.cc -o fft -lfftw3

Problem:
- None

Progress:
- COMPLETE
