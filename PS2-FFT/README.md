Problem set 2
- This coding activity was not from the problem set 2, but was a topic covered from the part 2
- It creates a fftw_complex which filled with {1, 2, 3...} then creates a plan to fft the fftw_complex to y
- Outputs the complex equations that resulted from the fftw plan

Main Idea:
- Was to try and work on FFT package and understand what occurs or happens

Problem:
- Facing issues with library, cant find library
