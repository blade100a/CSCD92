PS3 Workflow Parallelization
Harri Pahirathan

Part A:
A serial job to compute chemical bond breaking times can be found on the Teach cluster:
	1. Log into the teach cluster.
		- ssh lcl_uotcscd92s2111@teach.scinet.utoronto.ca
	2. Change directory to your scratch folder.
		- cd $SCRATCH
	3. Copy the material needed for this course.
		- cp -r /scinet/course/ss2020/1_introhpc $SCRATCH
	4. Change to the newly created directory.
		- cd 1_introhpc
	5. Submit the job sweep_bondbreak.sh with sbatch:
		- sbatch sweep_bondbreak.sh
	6. Check the status and performance of your job in the queue
		- jobperf JOBID, sacct, squeue
	7. Once completed, check the output in the file sweep_bondbreak_output.txt
		- cat sweep_bondbreak_output.txt
Part B:
The script `sweep_bondbreak.sh` executes 96 repeats of the computation of the bond breakage time, one by one.
However, these could all run in parallel.
	1. Time how long the (serial) job took.
		- 12 min 47 seconds with 00:12:47 CPU TIME
	2. Use GNU Parallel in a modified version of sweep_bondbreak.sh to parallelize the computation using 16 cores on a single compute node of the Teach cluster.
		- module load and added parrallel in the for loop
	3. Submit this new script to the scheduler.
		- sbatch again with new script
	4. How long did the new script take?
		- 30 seconds with 00:08:00 cpu time
	5. Add the script you modified and its job output (not the stuff in the "out" directory) to your git repository.
		- Added
